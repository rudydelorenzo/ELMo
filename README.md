# Welcome to the ELMo Library

## What's ELMo?
ELMo is a library that simplifies communication between ELM327 devices and ESP32 microprocessors. The library allows for this communication to happen synchronously, no more [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/)! This library is intended to be a barebones, yet easy-to-use middle man between your logic and the ELM327 device.

## How do I get it?
**Method 1: Arduino Library manager**
1. Open the library manager in your IDE of choice (Arduino IDE or PlatformIO)
2. Search for `ELMo`
3. Click install
4. `include` ELMo in your project
5. Profit!

**Method 2: GitHub Releases**
1. Go to the Releases page
2. Look at the latest version, denoted by the ![Latest Release](misc/latest_release.svg) tag
3. Download the source as a `.zip` file
4. Extract the `.zip` file to your `libraries` directory

## How do I use it?
Advanced instructions and function definitions can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/rudydelorenzo/ELMo/wiki). To get started, however, all you need to do is:
1. Create an ELMo instance with `ELMo ELM;`
2. Customize any of the settings if needed, or give the defaults a shot
3. Initialize the connection to the device with `ELM.initialize();`
    * You should probably do this in `setup();` 
5. Send messages to the device using `ELM.send("command");`
    * Wanna know what commands to send? Read on!

## On the subject of communications
The way that you communicate with an ELM device (and the way it communicates back) is by sending messages back and forth. The messages you send out are called **commands**.

There are two kinds of commands:
* "AT" commands
*  Mode + PID commands.

### AT Commands
__Most users will never have to issue an AT command.__

These messages are prepended by the letters "AT" (go figure) and are used to speak to the ELM controller chip. These commands are read by the ELM and NOT forwarded to the car.

"_Forget this! I want to talk to the car!_"

If this is you, I recommend sticking around for this quick word on AT commands. However, you can skip to the "__Mode + PID Commands__" section below for details on how to talk to the car. Now, back to AT Commands. Let's start with an example.

The command `AT Z` will tell the ELM327 device to reset itself. 
* `AT` means that this is a command intended for the ELM device itself, not for the car. 
* `Z` tells the ELM device to reset.

"_But wait!_", you say. "_How am I supposed to know that `Z` means "reset"?_"

Great question! __Everything you need to know about ELM327 commands is in the [ELM327 datasheet](https://www.elmelectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ELM327DSL.pdf)!__ AT Commands and their descriptions begin on [page 10](https://www.elmelectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ELM327DSL.pdf#page=10).

This document might seem overwhelming at first, but it contains lots of great information that'll let you unlock all the capabilities of your ELM327 reader.
I recommend reading it, it's a thrilling tale. However, you do NOT have to read the document from cover to cover in order to use ELMo.


### Mode + PID Commands
These are commands that let you talk with your car. They're typically composed of two parts, an OBD2 mode (aka. service) identifier and some OBD2 Parameter ID, or PID. Let's look at an example:

__`01 05`__

This command gives you the current Engine Coolant Temperature (ECT).

* Mode 01: This mode lets you check current car data.
* PID 05: This PID asks the car for the ECT. Had you sent a PID of __`01`__, the car would've given you stored DTCs (codes).

"_But wait!_", I hear you say. "_How am I supposed to know what 01 or 05 mean? How do I reset codes?_"

I'm glad you asked! There are two great resources to answer all your OBD2 questions:
* The [OBD-II PIDs Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs#Modes).
* The [ELM327 datasheet](https://www.elmelectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ELM327DSL.pdf). Modes and PID descriptions begin on [page 33](https://www.elmelectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ELM327DSL.pdf#page=33).

The datasheet might seem overwhelming at first, but it contains lots of great information that'll let you unlock all the capabilities of your ELM327 reader.
I recommend reading it, it's a thrilling tale. You can use the Find tool of your PDF viewer to search for any particular sections you may be interested in.

Here are some of the highlights:
* Talking to the Vehicle __(MUST READ!)__ [(page 33 and 34)](https://www.elmelectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ELM327DSL.pdf#page=33).
    * __NOTE__: The `ELMo.initialize()` function sends a `01 00` command so you don't have to.
    * This section contains mode definitions.
    * These pages contain instructions on how to send commands. I recommend reading this as well.
    * Details on how responses are formatted are also present here.
